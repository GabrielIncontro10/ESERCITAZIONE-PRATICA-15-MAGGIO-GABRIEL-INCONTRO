        <span class="v10_102">Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly
            illustrated narrative that speaks for itself. Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his
            career between graphic design and painting. Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own
            style, having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains. In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where
            he concentrates on graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”. However, within illustration, he
            described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication method based on simplicity and
            synthesis, with few tools and colours. I am interested in identifying people’s behaviour, portraying
            activities, intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing the amount of detail in a
            composition.” Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting scenic
            bus routes, art galleries and public figures in his own psychedelically shaped style. “Within my work I try
            to reproduce real moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.”</span>

            Francisco-based artist Tim Lahan’s naughty, witty artwork is the product of his ability to digest and
            illustrate clever glitches, concepts and interesting visual cues from the world around him. “I generally aim
            to make things as simple as possible,” says Tim. “Sometimes they come out funny.” Generally commissioned to
            bring a touch of joy to magazines, brand campaigns and music collateral, the ADC Young Gun award winner’s
            instantly recognisable style is enviably simple and genuinely funny: something very few illustrators can
            boast.</span>

            Karlotta also dedicates her time to sharing her knowledge with the next generation of artists. She has
            taught illustration at the China Academy of Art and spoken as a guest speaker at universities across the
            United States. Freier's work has also been exhibited in a variety of solo and group exhibitions, as well as
            festivals worldwide. Her achievements have been recognized by the Art Directors Club, which awarded her a

            of LA-based illustrator Xoana Herrera is an explosion of sumptuous, stylish character scenes dwelling in a
            world that, frankly, looks ideal. Xoana trained as a graphic designer in Argentina but over time found
            herself drawn to the world of illustration after a five-year stint at Buck agency. Now, alongside founding a
            feminist creative collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, complex and accessible imagery which would
            be as at home in an ad campaign as it would be in a children’s book (which she's quite keen to try soon).
            “As an artist I think it is up to us to keep evolving and taking creative decisions,” she says. “Aiming to
            be innovative is something I feel I can dare to try every time I take a job, and that’s amazing.”</span>

            illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz lives and works in London where she creates charmingly clean,
            precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and commercial clients. Her
            neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as “hands down one
            of the best experiences” of her life. “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as a person.” she says,
            “It pushed me to work harder and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world.” The progressive nature of
            Hyper Island led Linn to abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital could offer her already
            well-honed drawings. As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing digitally, and more room for mistakes.”
            Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a community of
            equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect and support each other within the
            animation industry.” Some of her favorite projects often orbit around her interests of “feminism, clothes,
            plants and interior” but Linn also looks for a good client relationship, one with trust and creative
            freedom.</span>

            the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking
            in your dad’s record collection. The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London and has gathered an
            envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, and the AOI Illustration
            Awards. Their exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of each of the studio's
            members' unique influences, having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland. “We work as a
            studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall of La Boca. “It's not unusual to
            have two or three people working on a single piece.” Keen to work on more animated projects in the future,
            the team (based in two studios, one in London and one in Amsterdam) are never short on work from a selection
            of devoted clients. In their own words, La Boca’s creations are: “Retina teasing, tactile and occasionally
            slightly wonky.”
